# Supra Source Code

This repository contains a collection of closed-source smart contracts for the Supra Network and its associated protocols. These contracts have not been made available on the official Supra Network GitHub repository.

## Background
Due to a lack of understanding of the Aptos-Core, Supra Network and its protocols accidentally published their closed-source smart contracts on-chain. After discovering this, I reached out to the team to report the issue. Unfortunately, as is often the case with some companies, they denied the issue, claiming that the publication of the contract source code on-chain was intentional.

## Questions Unanswered
If the source code was intentionally published on-chain, there are still a few important questions that remain unanswered:

1. **Why are these contracts not available on GitHub?**
   - If the contracts are indeed open-source, they should be available on GitHub for public access and collaboration, correct?
   
2. **Why is there no feature to display contract source code on SupraScan?**
   - I initially inquired about this on Discord, and the Supra Network team admitted they didn’t know how to display the contract source code on their block explorer. This raises further doubts about their claim of intent.

Despite multiple attempts to receive a logical explanation, the Supra Network team has not provided any satisfactory answers. It seems that they are unwilling to acknowledge their mistake, likely to avoid the financial burden of paying a bug bounty (which I understand, given the current state of their project). They have also expressed concerns about preserving their image, which may be why they allowed me to publish their closed-source contracts on my GitHub repository.

## Legality and Transparency
I want to clarify that I am not engaging in any illegal activity. I have received explicit permission from the Supra Network team to publish these contracts, and I have documentation of their response via email as proof. 

## Concerns about Supra Network
In my opinion, the actions of the Supra Network team raise serious questions about the security and long-term viability of their platform. They have been unable to protect their own source code, which does not inspire confidence in their ability to secure users' investments. Despite being six months post-mainnet launch, the Supra Network ecosystem is still extremely limited, with only one DApp—Dexlyn—available. Even the source code for Dexlyn is closed-source and publicly available in this repository.

Given the lack of transparency, security, and progress, I would strongly advise potential investors and developers to reconsider their involvement with Supra Network. Personally, I am bearish on the platform, and I believe it is prudent to exercise caution when it comes to investing or building on this network.

## Conclusion
Ultimately, the decision is yours to make. But as someone who has followed the project closely, I find myself questioning the integrity and sustainability of Supra Network. I would encourage everyone to do their own research and make informed decisions.
